# Express.JS Tutorial

  ## Q1 Express Introduction?
   Express.js is a popular framework of Node.js that allows developers to run Javascript code outside of the browser. Express.js, commonly known as Express, is a minimal and flexible 
   web application framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features for building web and mobile applications. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/home)

   Before starting, we need Node to be Installed on our machine. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/express-installation)

  ## Q3 Express Request?
   In Express.js, handling HTTP requests is a fundamental aspect of building web applications. Express provides a simple and intuitive way to handle incoming requests.
   Here's an overview of handling requests in Express: [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/request)
   
  ## Q4 Express Response?
   In Express.js, the "res" object, representing the HTTP response, is used to send data back to the client. In an Express.js application, sending a response to a client is a 
   fundamental operation. Express provides various methods to send responses back to clients, such as sending plain text, HTML, JSON, or files.  [read more] (https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/response)
   
  ## Q5 Express Get Request?
   In Express.js, handling HTTP GET requests is a fundamental aspect of building web applications. Express provides a straightforward way to define routes for handling these requests. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/get-request)

  ## Q6 Express Post Request?
   In Express.js, handling HTTP POST requests is common when dealing with forms and data submissions. To handle POST requests in Express.js, we need to use the `post()` method to define a route that listens for POST requests. The data sent from the client to the server can be accessed from the request body using `req.body`. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/post-request)

  ## Q7 Express Put Request?
   In Express.js, handling HTTP PUT requests is common for updating existing resources. To handle `PUT` requests in Express.js, we can use the `put()` method to define a route that listens for PUT requests. Like POST requests, the data sent from the client to the server can be accessed from the request body using `req.body`. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/put-request)  
   
  ## Q8 Express Middleware?
   Middleware functions in Express.js are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the application's 
   request-response cycle. These functions can perform various tasks, modify the request and response objects, and terminate the request-response cycle by sending a response or passing control to the next middleware function. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/middleware)

  ## Q9 Express File Upload?
   In Express.js, handling file uploads can be achieved using middleware such as multer. Multer is a popular middleware for handling multipart/form-data, which is used for file uploads. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/file-upload)
   
  ## Q10 Express Routing?
   In Express.js, routing is a mechanism that defines how an application responds to client requests at specific endpoints or URLs. Routing in Express helps organize the code and manage different parts of an application based on the requested resource. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/routing)

  ## Q11 Express Cookies?
   In Express.js, We can work with cookies to store and retrieve information on the client side. Cookies are small pieces of data sent from a server and stored on the client's browser. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/cookies)
   
  ## Q12 Express Template?
   In Express.js, templates are typically used to render dynamic content and generate HTML pages dynamically. There are several template engines available for Express.js, such as Pug (formerly Jade), EJS (Embedded JavaScript), Handlebars, and more.

  ## Q13 Express Static Files Serving?
   In Express.js, we can serve static files (such as CSS, images, or client-side Javascript) using the "express.static" middleware. This middleware function is based on the serve-static module. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/static-files-serving)
   
  ## Q14 Express Scaffolding?
   Scaffolding in the context of web development typically refers to generating a basic project structure with some predefined files and folders to help us get started quickly.
   While there isn't a built-in scaffolding tool for Express.js provided by the framework itself, there are several community tools and generators that can assist us in setting up a 
   basic project structure. [read more](https://www.instanests.com/tech/express/scaffolding)
